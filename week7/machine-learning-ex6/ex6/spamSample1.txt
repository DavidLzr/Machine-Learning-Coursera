Dear Students,

I have uploaded a copy pf the 2018 midterm under the files folder in LumiNUS in response to students' request for more practices. Do note that the syllabus and content for the current iteration of DSA1101 differ from past years'. I will be briefly going through the highlighted questions in lecture on Tuesday (1 October). 


With best regards,

BaoLuo
